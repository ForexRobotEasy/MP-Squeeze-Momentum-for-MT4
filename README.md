# MP Squeeze Momentum

This is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to help traders identify periods of low volatility (squeeze) and high volatility (breakout) in the market. The indicator combines the Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to determine the squeeze period and release period. The squeeze period is identified when the lower Bollinger Band is above the lower Keltner Channel and the upper Bollinger Band is below the upper Keltner Channel. The release period is identified when the squeeze period is not active. Breakouts are identified when the squeeze period is followed by a release period.

## Indicator Parameters

- `bbPeriod` (default: 20): The period used to calculate the Bollinger Bands.
- `bbDeviation` (default: 2.0): The standard deviation used to calculate the Bollinger Bands.
- `kcPeriod` (default: 20): The period used to calculate the Keltner Channels.
- `kcMultiplier` (default: 2.0): The multiplier used to calculate the Keltner Channels.

## Usage

The MP Squeeze Momentum indicator can be used to identify periods of low volatility and high volatility in the market. Traders can use this information to adjust their trading strategies accordingly. During the squeeze period, when volatility is low, traders may consider using range trading strategies. During the release period, when volatility is high, traders may consider using breakout or trend-following strategies. The breakout signals generated by the indicator can be used to enter trades in the direction of the breakout.
